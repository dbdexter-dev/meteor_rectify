# Meteor-M2 image rectifier

This is a free, open-source image processor that corrects the deformation
visible on images from the Meteor-M2 weather satellite. Although specifically
designed for this satellite, it can easily be adapted to correct for the Earth's
curvature at any given height.

## Requirements

This script depends on `pillow` and `numpy`. You can install them by issuing the following 
commands:

```
pip install pillow
pip install numpy
```
